Challange

Challange was i started this course with little knowladge of javascript and Es-6 i had to to study a lot javascrtipt and html and css to understand what is going on.
i have spend to much time to understand the current way of handling states and api and UI. The udacity course was mostly class based so it was a harder to wrap my mind in handling react states and changes .
